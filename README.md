# Plant-Disease-Classification-using-CNNs
In this Colab notebook, we will explore the classification of plant conditions (Rust, Powdery, Healthy) using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Our goal is to build a model that achieves high accuracy in predicting these conditions from images of plants.


**Dataset:**

For this project, we will utilize the Plant Disease Recognition dataset curated by rashikrahmanpritom, which is available on Kaggle. You can access the dataset using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset
